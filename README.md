# Scrolling-Shooter 🎮✈️  

A classic arcade-style scrolling shooter built in **GameMaker Studio 2**.  
This project was developed as part of a workshop assignment to learn fundamentals of game development such as object-oriented design, event handling, and game loops.

- **Enemy planes** that spawn continuously and can collide with or shoot at the player.  
- **Rocks/obstacles** that damage the player on contact.  
- **Bullet system** for player attacks.  
- **Explosions** with sound effects when enemies are destroyed.  
- **Health bar** that decreases on collisions.  
- **Score tracking** that increases as enemies are defeated.  
- **Game Over screen** with option to restart (`Press R`).  

## 🕹️ Controls
